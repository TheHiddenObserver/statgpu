## 0.2.3 — 2026-08-04

### Survival analysis

- Completed CoxPH Phase 1 with Breslow, Efron, and Exact ties; delayed-entry
  and `(start, stop]` counting-process data; shared-coefficient stratification;
  subject identifiers; and `Surv(start, stop, event)` formula input.
- Added shared NumPy, CuPy, and Torch-CUDA risk-set primitives for objectives,
  gradients, information matrices, and baseline estimation. Exact tied-event
  partitions use backend-native dynamic programming.
- Extended `CoxPHCV` held-out partial likelihood to all supported tie methods,
  delayed entry, start-stop rows, strata, and subject-grouped folds.
- Hardened Cox inference, centered risk-set numerics, log-domain baseline
  prediction, formula NA alignment, singular-information handling, CV cache
  identity, fold eligibility, selected-penalty refitting, and failed-fit state
  resets.
- Hardened L1, L2, Elastic Net, SCAD, and MCP penalized Cox estimation; removed
  the unidentified intercept; corrected Cox-specific warm starts; and made the
  Torch Efron value, gradient, and Hessian paths native.

### Cross-validation and grouped penalties

- Requested CoxPHCV two-stage and successive-halving controls now execute one
  explicit exhaustive full-precision candidate pass, preserving deterministic
  selection while avoiding repeated complete-grid fitting.
- One-shot `CoxPHCV.cv_splits` iterators are reusable across repeated fit,
  scikit-learn clone, parameter reconstruction, and pickle.
- Public Group Lasso and Adaptive Group Lasso use the generic loss-gradient and
  exact group-proximal path consistently across supported backends.

### Validation and packaging

- Hosted workflow #960 passed on final reviewed head
  `f05a44ad363b46612e956e137e2f00d040765acb`: documentation, static, full CPU,
  and Python 3.9–3.12 regression jobs all passed; the complete CPU suite reported
  1881 passed and 662 skipped.
- The final exact-head physical-GPU promotion artifact is published as
  [schema-3 evidence](https://gist.github.com/TheHiddenObserver/afdcad86a243e68a918d852b92e984a4).
  It records 134/134 passing checks, zero child and nested return codes, empty
  gate-failure arrays, clean source state before and after execution, and SHA-256
  `bd4058450def691dd29e9d78853534016c6da70c33192a97dc312d95cbe5d76d`.
- The package version is now `0.2.3`. Release-package validation checks version
  consistency, builds the pure-Python wheel and sdist, runs `twine check`,
  validates artifact contents, and smoke-installs both distributions in clean
  environments.
